/**
 * Guards this module's third-party attribution.
 * <p>
 * Driven by two checked-in resources: {@code attribution-manifest.tsv}, one row per
 * {@code src/main/java} file, and {@code attribution-artefacts.tsv}, the module's licence files
 * plus the exact tuples its {@code licenses.xml} must declare.
 * <p>
 * Three properties are what stop this guard from quietly ceasing to guard, which is a failure this
 * codebase has hit repeatedly:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>A missing input FAILS; it never skips.</b> There is no {@code assumeTrue} and no
 * empty-collection short circuit. If the manifest, the source tree or {@code licenses.xml} is not
 * where it is expected, the build goes red.</li>
 * <li><b>Coverage is a set equality in both directions.</b> Every manifest row must name a real
 * file, and every source file must have a row, so a NEW file cannot slip in unattributed.</li>
 * <li><b>Floors.</b> Hard-coded minimum counts, so deleting the sources and their manifest rows
 * together cannot make the equality vacuously true. Lower one only deliberately.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Deliberately NOT Spotless {@code licenseHeader}: that goal <i>applies</i>, so it would stamp a
 * missing notice back in -- a check that repairs what it should report -- and it cannot tell a file
 * ported from upstream from one P300 wrote.
 * <p>
 * This test travels with the module, so it gates in whichever repository the module ends up in and
 * is not bypassable by working in a submodule directly.
